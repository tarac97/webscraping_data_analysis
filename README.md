# webscraping_data_analysis
First python project (ever) completed during Masters course.

This mini project explores the effect of cannabis consumption on alcohol intake in the US. It was part of a data programming module which required web-scraping and data analysis.
Under 'Assignment one' is the data collection and cleaning process. 'Assignment two' is the analysis and a short discussion at the end.
Enjoy :)

# webscraping_data_analysis
Python project during Masters course

This mini project explores the effect of cannabis consumption on alcohol intake in the US. It was part of a data programming module which required web-scraping and data analysis.
Under 'Assignment one' is the data collection and cleaning process. 'Assignment two' is the analysis and a short discussion at the end.
Enjoy :)
